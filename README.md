# Overview

Created a client server network that allows multiple people to log on and chat with each other. To log on you need the IP address and the client code.
The purpose is to learn how networks work and to eventually make board games that are playable online.

# Network Communication
Used a client-server TCP network with port number 9999
messages are strings converted into bytes.
# Development Environment
The code was written entirely in python, tools used socket, sys, threading, and socketserver libraries.

# Future Work
* Item 1 Create an inteface.
* Item 2 Allow users to run code through server, not just send messages, run functions
* Item 3 Make a playable board game out of my other repository.
